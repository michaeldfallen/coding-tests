# To do app front-end

This test is to build a web based user interface for an existing server based application  
used to capture a to-do list.  
The features that form the to-do app are described as [user stories]. There are 
some [technical requirements] that we require you adhere to. Finally we have 
some [expectations] that describes what we expect from you.


## User Stories

*As a* forgetful person  
*I need* to record things I need to do  
*so that* I will never forget them

*As a* proactive person  
*I need* to see the to dos I haven't yet done  
*so that* I can pick the next one to do

*As a* successful to do doer  
*I need* to mark a to do as complete  
*so that* I don't see it on my list of unfinished to dos

*As a* person with demands on my time  
*I need* to prioritise my to dos  
*so that* I don't forget which are most important to do

*As a* person with sight impairment  
*I need* assistive technology to help me interact with web browsers 
*so that* I can use this to-do service.

*So that* some users with restricted internet access(e.g. older browser, access via restrictive proxy server) can use the service
*the* to-do application user interface
*will need* to be designed with this in mind.



## Technical Requirements

- Develop the UI using HTML and CSS

## Expectations

All of these expectations are up to your own judgement. If you think you should
you can deviate from these expectations.

**We expect:**
- A Restful API to pass data to/from the backend service. The detail is up to you.
- A simple user interface
- A Readme that describes what you've built and how to run it

**We don't expect:**
- The app deployed anywhere
- The actual backend service to be implemented by you.
- Data to be persisted in a database or locally in a browser.
- Exhaustive documentation

We have expectations that we have not documented here. Use your best judgement.
