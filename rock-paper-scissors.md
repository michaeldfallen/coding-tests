## Technical Requirements

- Languages that are allowed are Node.JS and Java
- You can use either language for either component
- You can use any libraries or frameworks
- Use as little client side Javascript as you can


## Expectations

**We expect:**
- A Restful API
- A simple web frontend
- A Readme that describes what you've built and how to run it

**We don't expect:**
